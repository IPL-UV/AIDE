Evaluations
===========

The final stage of the toolboxâ€™s pipeline involves the evaluation of results. Once the training is completed, the users will have a trained algorithm at their disposal, ready to tackle the problem of their choice. This module is subdivided into two stages: testing (Metrics) and inference (Visualization, Characterization and XAI). These provide the users with a comprehensive set of tools to evaluate how well their algorithm
generalises to unseen or real-world data, using the test subset of data for both cases. In this section we prove an overview of these tools.
